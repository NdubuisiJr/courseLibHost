                    The SpinLock struct lets you lock without incurring the cost of a context switch, at the expense of keeping a thread
                    spinning (uselessly busy). This approach is valid in high-contention scenarios when locking will be very brief (e.g., in
                    writing a thread-safe linked list from scratch).
